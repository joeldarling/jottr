A simple app to help get the writing juices flowing. Instead of being overwhelmed with editing and formatting your text while writing,
you can just write. But, there is a timer. If you don't write anything for a certain period of time, then the writing session is over. 

To save your progress as time goes one, after writing a certain number of words, you can 'commit' the paragraph. Once you're done
writing, you can then copy your text to the clipboard. 

Still a work in progress.
